There was once a kid named Sree.

He didnt complete his GitHub assignment in time. And was very glad that he was granted an extension for it.

After Sree submitted his GitHub assignment, hewas thinking about Harriet Parker again. Harriet was a bold queen with ample arms. Sree walked over to the window and reflected on his magical surroundings. He had always loved cosy Madison with its broad lakes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel surprised.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a bold figure of Harriet Parker.

Sree glanced at his own reflection. He was a controlling, hopeful, freshman.  The rain hammered like laughing snakes, making Sree angry. Sree grabbed a peculiar sausage that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers. As Sree stepped outside and Harriet came closer, he could see the nice smile on her face. “Look Sree,” growled Harriet, with an admirable glare that reminded Sree of their last encounter. “It’s not that I don’t love you, but I want a wifi code.”

"A wifi password," he stammered back,"but I only have this peculiar sausage," shaking it in her direction. 

"Eeeeew" she screeched, and just as mysteriously as she appeared she was gone. Suddenly with a gasp Sree's eyes were open and he was lying in his bed, he 
had just enough time to blink the sleep from his eyes when the a sudden realization washed over him. "Shit!" he mutters under his breath, as he jumps up
from his bed, he checks the clock and sees 11:41 P.M., his github assignment is due in 19 minutes.
