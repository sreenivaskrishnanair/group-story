There was once a kid named Sree.

He didnt complete his GitHub assignment in time. And was very glad that he was granted an extension for it.

After Sree submitted his GitHub assignment, hewas thinking about Harriet Parker again. Harriet was a bold queen with ample arms. Sree walked over to the window and reflected on his magical surroundings. He had always loved cosy Madison with its broad lakes. It was a place that encouraged his tendency to feel surprised.
Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the a bold figure of Harriet Parker.

Sree glanced at his own reflection. He was a controlling, hopeful, freshman.  The rain hammered like laughing snakes, making Sree angry. Sree grabbed a peculiar sausage that had been strewn nearby; he massaged it with his fingers. As Sree stepped outside and Harriet came closer, he could see the nice smile on her face. “Look Sree,” growled Harriet, with an admirable glare that reminded Sree of their last encounter. “It’s not that I don’t love you, but I want a wifi code.”
